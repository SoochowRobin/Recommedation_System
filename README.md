# Film_Recommedation_System
# Recommedation_System

It is a capstone project provided by Duke Unversity.

The task is to implement a simple recommedation system based on 
the rating score provided by raters and then to recommend some potential 
movies that may attract raters.

The core philosophy is to calculate the two raters similarity firstly and 
then pick some potential movies multiply the weights, and pick 
sorted ones.

The entire project is implemented by Java.
